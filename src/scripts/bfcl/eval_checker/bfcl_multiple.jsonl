If the given question lacks the parameters required by the function, also point it out.\n You should only return the function calls in your response.\n If you decide to invoke any of the function(s), you MUST put it in the format of [func_name1(params_name1=params_value1, params_name2=params_value2...), func_name2(params)] \n You SHOULD NOT include any other text in the response. \n At each turn, your should try your best to complete the tasks requested by the user within the current turn. Continue to output functions to call until you have fulfilled the user's request to the best of your ability. Once you have no more functions to call, the system will consider the current turn complete and proceed to the next turn or task.You have access to the following tools:\n> Tool Name: forest_growth_forecast\nTool Description: Predicts the forest growth over the next N years based on current trends.\nTool Args:\n  - location (string, required): The location where you want to predict forest growth.\n  - years (integer, required): The number of years for the forecast.\n  - include_human_impact (boolean): Whether or not to include the impact of human activities in the forecast. If not provided, defaults to false.\n\n> Tool Name: db_fetch_records\nTool Description: Fetch records from a specified database table based on certain conditions.\nTool Args:\n  - database_name (string, required): The name of the database.\n  - table_name (string, required): The name of the table from which records need to be fetched.\n  - conditions (dict, required): The conditions based on which records are to be fetched.\n  - fetch_limit (integer): Limits the number of records to be fetched. If left empty, it fetches all records. (Optional) Default is 0.\n\nUse the following format if using a tool:\n```\nAction: tool name (one of [forest_growth_forecast, db_fetch_records])\nAction Input: the input to the tool, in a JSON format representing the kwargs (e.g. ```{\"input\": \"hello world\", \"num_beams\": 5}```)\n```\nuser\n\nPredict the growth of forest in Yellowstone for the next 5 years including human impact.assistant\n\nAction: forest_growth_forecast\nAction Input: {\"location\": [\"Yellowstone\", \"yellowstone\"], \"years\": [5], \"include_human_impact\": [true]}\ntool\n\nassistant\n\n", "label": "[{\"name\": \"forest_growth_forecast\", \"arguments\": {\"location\": [\"Yellowstone\", \"yellowstone\"], \"years\": [5], \"include_human_impact\": [true]}}]", "predict": "Action: forest_growth_forecast\nAction Input: {\"location\": \"Yellowstone\", \"years\": 5, \"include_human_impact\": true}"}
