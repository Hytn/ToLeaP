The pistons are connected to a crankshaft, which transforms the linear motion of the pistons into rotational motion. This rotational motion is then transferred to the wheels via the transmission and drive shaft, allowing the car to move. The engine also has a cooling system to prevent overheating and a lubrication system to reduce friction between moving parts.\"}",
