First, we need to calculate the revenue for a given period of time. So, we call the `calculateRevenue` API with the given revenue and some default dates and room category.\n2. Then, we need to calculate the net income after calculating the revenue. So, we call the `calculateNetIncome` API with the calculated revenue and expenses.\n3. We don't need any other information from the income statement, so we just call the `getIncomeStatement` API without any parameters.\n4. We don't need any information from the government revenue, so we just call the `getGovernmentRevenue` API without any parameters.\n\nNote: The `API_call_0` is used as a parameter in the `calculateNetIncome` API and `API_call_1` is used as a response in the `calculateRevenue` API.",

The task instruction is to \"Calculate the power output for a cycling activity that lasts for 85 minutes.\" which means we need to call the `getPowerOutput` API with `activity` as \"cycling\" and `duration` as 85.\n2. Since there is no additional information required for the `calculateInverterPower` API, we don't need to pass any parameters.\n3. For the `getEnginePower` API, we don't have any specific information, so we can leave the `vehicle_id` and `unit` as empty strings.\n\nNote that the `calculateEnergyOutput` and `calculateFriisEquation` APIs are not needed for this task, so they are not included in the list.",

This implies that we need to get the current status of the shipment with the given ID and the carrier.\n2. The `getShipmentStatus` API is suitable for this task as it retrieves the current status of a shipment. It requires both `shipment_id` and `carrier` as parameters, which are provided in the task instruction.\n3. The `trackShipment` API is also suitable for this task as it tracks the progress of a shipment, but it only requires a `tracking_number` which is not sufficient to get the carrier information. So, we choose `getShipmentStatus` over `trackShipment`.\n4. The `customsDeclarationStatus` API is not suitable as it requires a `country` parameter which is not provided in the task instruction.\n5. The `updateShipmentDetails` API is not suitable as it updates the details of a shipment, not checks the status.\n\nThe `trackOrder` API is not suitable as it only tracks the shipment of an order, not the status of a shipment.\n\nThe `getShipmentStatus` API returns `status`, `estimated_delivery_date`, and `location` which are the required information to check the status of the shipment.",

This is done by passing \"CommunityGrowth\" as the value for the `enterprise_name` parameter.\n2. The response of `getSocialEnterpriseInfo` API will contain the `impact` which is used as the `enterprise_id` parameter for the next API call.\n3. Then, we call `getSocialEnterpriseDetails` API to get the name, category, and description of the social enterprise.

First, we need to add David to the team as a developer, so we call the `addMemberToTeam` API with the required parameters `name`, `email`, and `role`.\n2. Then, we need to add David to a software engineering project, so we call the `addMember` API with the required parameters `project_id` and `member_id`.

Since the task instruction is to retrieve the national security level, we also need to call the `getNationalSecurityLevel` API again without the year parameter to get the current national security level. This is because the year parameter is not required, so we can set it to the current year.\n\nHere's the Python code to generate the API calling list:\n\n```\napi_calling_list = []\nfor api in api_list:\n    if api['api_name'] == 'getNationalSecurityLevel':\n        api_calling_list.append({\"api\": api['api_name'], \"parameters\": {param: 'United States' if param in ['country'] else '2020' for param in api['parameters'].keys(), \"responses\": [f\"API_call_{i}\" for i in range(len(api['responses'])))\n    else:\n        api_calling_list.append({\"api\": api['api_name'], \"parameters\": {param: 'United States' if param in ['country'] else '2020' for param in api['parameters'].keys(), \"responses\": [f\"API_call_{i}\" for i in range(len(api['responses'])})\nprint(api_calling_list)\n```\n\nThis code iterates over the `api_list` and checks if the API name is `getNationalSecurityLevel`. If it is, it sets the country parameter to \"United States\" and the year parameter to 2020. If the API name is not `getNationalSecurityLevel`, it sets the country parameter to \"United States\" and the year parameter to 2020. The responses are generated as \"API_call_0\", \"API_call_1\", etc.",

First, we need to create a library with the name, location, capacity, opening hours, and website. We don't have this information in the task instruction, so we'll leave the parameters as empty strings. Then, we'll get the library ID as a response.\n2. Next, we need to add a collection to this library with the name \"The Rhythm of Dreams\" and type \"Counter\".

The task instruction is to translate \"Where is the nearest restaurant?\" to Swedish, so we need to call the `translateToSwedish` API with the text \"Where is the nearest restaurant?\" as a parameter.\n2. The response of this API will be the translation of the text in Swedish, which is the pronunciation of the phrase in Swedish. However, the task instruction also asks for the pronunciation of the word \"restaurant\" in Norwegian. So, we need to call the `pronounceNorwegianWord` API with the word \"restaurang\" (the Norwegian word for \"restaurant\") as a parameter.\n\nNote: The Norwegian word for \"restaurant\" is \"restaurang\", not \"restaurant\".",

The task instruction is to \"Check the loyalty status of the customer with ID jXEhzl93cW2\". This requires calling the `checkLoyaltyStatus` API with the customer ID and a loyalty program. We'll use the default loyalty program for now, so we'll use a placeholder \"API_call_0\" as the value for the loyalty program.\n2. After checking the loyalty status, we need to retrieve the loyalty points information of the same customer. This requires calling the `getLoyaltyPoints` API with the customer ID. We'll use another placeholder \"API_call_1\" as the value for the membership level.\n\nNote: The actual API calls will depend on the responses from the previous API calls. For example, if the loyalty status is not available, we might need to call another API to get the loyalty program and then use that to call `getLoyaltyPoints`.

For the task instruction \"Show me the interior design of Harmony Lounge with a cool tone color scheme\", we need to get the interior design of Harmony Lounge with a cool tone color scheme. This can be achieved by calling the `getRestaurantInteriorDesign` API with `restaurant_name` as \"Harmony Lounge\" and `style` as \"cool tone\".\n2. Then, we need to get the interior design of Harmony Lounge. This can be achieved by calling the `getInteriorDesign` API with `building_name` as \"Harmony Lounge\", `style` as \"cool tone\", `area` as 0 (assuming the area is not provided), and `budget` as 0 (assuming the budget is not provided).\n3. Next, we need to get the design elements and estimated cost for an event. This can be achieved by calling the `getEventDesignAndDecor` API with no parameters.\n4. Finally, we need to get the design style for a residential property and seating capacity of the office. This can be achieved by calling the `getResidentialDesignStyle` API with `location` as \"Harmony Lounge\" and `budget` as 0 (assuming the budget is not provided), and `getOfficeDesign` API with `company_name` as \"Harmony Lounge\" and `location` as \"Harmony Lounge\", and `number_of_employees` as 0 (assuming the number of employees is not provided).\n\nNote: The `getResidentialDesignStyle` and `getOfficeDesign` APIs are called with `location` as \"Harmony Lounge\" because the task instruction does not specify a residential property or office, so we assume it's the same as the restaurant.",

Then, we need a topic for the essay, so we call the `getEssayTopic` API with the length 500 words to get a suggested topic.\n3. Finally, we need to self-publish the essay, so we call the `selfPublishing` API with no parameters to publish the essay.\n\nNote that the `getShortStory` API is not needed in this task, and the `getEssayExamples` API is also not needed as we are not retrieving examples of personal essays, but rather generating a new one.",

First, we need to translate \"Ahoj\" to Czech language using the `translateToCzech` API. This will give us the translated text in Czech language.\n2. Then, we need to use the pronunciation API for the translated text to get the pronunciation of the translated text. Since the translated text is in Czech, we will use the `pronounceCzech` API (assuming there is a `pronounceCzech` API, if not, we can use `pronounceHungarian` or `pronounceNorwegian` based on the language).\n\nHere's the code to generate the API calling list:\n```\napi_calling_list = []\nfor api in api_list:\n    if api['api_name'] == 'translateToCzech' and task_instruction.startswith('Tell me how to say \"'):\n        api_calling_list.append({\"api\": api['api_name'], \"parameters\": api['parameters'], \"responses\": [f\"API_call_{len(api_calling_list}\"])\n    elif api['api_name'] == 'pronounceCzech':\n        api_calling_list.append({\"api\": api['api_name'], \"parameters\": {\"text\": f\"API_call_{len(api_calling_list-1}\"})\n    elif api['api_name'] == 'pronounceHungarian' and task_instruction.startswith('Tell me how to say \"'):\n        api_calling_list.append({\"api\": api['api_name'], \"parameters\": {\"word\": f\"API_call_{len(api_calling_list-1}\"})\n    elif api['api_name'] == 'pronounceNorwegian' and task_instruction.startswith('Tell me how to say \"'):\n        api_calling_list.append({\"api\": api['api_name'], \"parameters\": {\"word\": f\"API_call_{len(api_calling_list-1}\"})\n    elif api['api_name'] == 'learnHungarianWord' and task_instruction.startswith('Tell me how to say \"'):\n        api_calling_list.append({\"api\": api['api_name'], \"parameters\": {}})\n    elif api['api_name'] == 'getRandomCzechPhrase':\n        pass\n    else:\n        pass\n```\n\nNote: I assumed there is a `pronounceCzech` API, if not, you can use `pronounceHungarian` or `pronounceNorwegian` based on the language.

This is done by calling the `getImmunizationSchedule` API with the species as \"dog\" and age as 288 (23 years * 12 months/year).\n2. Then, we need to retrieve the immunization status of the dog. This is done by calling the `getImmunizationStatus` API with the animal_id (which is not provided, so it's left as an empty string), species as \"dog\", and vaccine_year (which is not provided, so it's left as an empty string). The vaccine_type is also not provided, so it's left as an empty string.\n\nNote: The `getImmunizationStatus` API is called twice, once for each vaccine year from 2019 to 2021 (assuming the vaccine years are 2019, 2020, 2021).",

The task instruction is to provide information about the vessel named \"MSC Seaview\". This requires calling the `getVesselInfo` API with the parameter `vessel_name` set to \"MSC Seaview\" to retrieve the vessel's type, country, and length.\n2. Since the task also requires the current location of the vessel, we need to call the `getShipLocation` API to get the latitude and longitude coordinates. However, we need the `ship_id` parameter for this API, which is not provided in the task instruction. Since we don't have this information, we'll assume it's not available. If we had the `ship_id`, we could call `getShipLocation` with the `ship_id` as a parameter and retrieve the latitude and longitude.\n\nNote: The `shipOrder` API is not relevant to this task instruction as it's about shipping an order, not retrieving information about a vessel.

The task instruction is to provide critical illness insurance coverage for a 13-year-old male policy holder. \n   - We need to call the `getCICoverage` API to get the coverage information. The age of the policy holder is 13, so we set `age` to 13. The gender is male, so we set `gender` to \"Male\". Since the policy holder is a minor, we assume they are non-smokers, so `smoking_status` is set to \"non-smoker\".\n   - We also need to call the `getCriticalIllnessInsuranceCoverage` API to get the coverage details. The age of the policy holder is 13, so we set `policy_holder_age` to 13. The gender is male, so we set `gender` to \"Male\". Since the policy holder is a minor, we set `smoker` to `False` (assuming they are non-smokers).\n\nNote: The `getPolicyCoverage` and `getHealthInsuranceCoverage` APIs are not relevant to this task instruction, and the `validateBenefits` API is not applicable as it's for long-term care insurance, not critical illness insurance.",

The task instruction is to \"Calibrate the sensors for flight AA1234 at an altitude of 77 and a speed of 26\". This means we need to call the `calibrateAircraftSensors` API with the flight number as \"AA1234\", altitude as 77, and speed as 26.\n2. Since there is no specific instruction to calibrate any sensors for the robotic system, we don't need to provide any parameters for `calibrateRobotSensors` API, so we leave it empty.\n3. We also need to call `detectObjects` API, but it requires `range`, `angle`, and `resolution` as parameters. Since these are not provided in the task instruction, we leave them as empty strings.\n4. The `calibrateVRHardware` API is not relevant to this task, so we don't call it.\n5.

Then, we need to calculate the optimal capacity of renewable energy sources to meet 50% of the current electricity demand, so we call the `calculateRenewableEnergyCapacity` API with the parameters `demand` (which will be retrieved from the sales data) and `renewable_percentage=\"50\"`.\n3. Finally, we need to retrieve performance metrics for the supplier with ID `8c9o7Z2Gqd`, so we call the `getSupplierPerformance` API with the parameter `supplier_id=\"8c9o7Z2Gqd`.\n\nNote that the `demand` parameter in the `calculateRenewableEnergyCapacity` API is not provided, as it will be retrieved from the sales data returned by the `getSalesData` API.",
    "Here is the list of API calls based on the task instruction:\n\n```\n[\n    {\"api\": \"getThermalComfort\", \"parameters\": {\"temperature\": \"20.5\", \"relative_humidity\": \"60.2\"}, \"responses\": [\"API_call_0\"]},\n    {\"api\": \"getHVACData\", \"parameters\": {\"building_id\": \"BCD34XY\", \"start_date\": \"\", \"end_date\": \"\"}, \"responses\": [\"API_call_1\", \"API_call_2\", \"API_call_3\", \"API_call_4\"]},\n    {\"api\": \"modifyDatabase\", \"parameters\": {\"database_name\": \"users_db\", \"new_storage_size\": \"1000\"}, \"responses\": [\"API_call_5\"]\n]\n```\n\nHere's the explanation:\n\n1. First, we need to retrieve the thermal comfort information based on the temperature of 20.5 degrees Celsius and relative humidity of 60.2 percent. This is done by calling the `getThermalComfort` API with the temperature and relative humidity as parameters.\n2. Then, we need to retrieve the HVAC data for building 'BCD34XY' including temperature, humidity, and energy consumption. This is done by calling the `getHVACData` API with the building ID as a parameter. Since the API returns multiple responses (temperature, humidity, and energy consumption), we need to make a separate API call for each response.\n3. Finally, we need to modify the configuration of the database 'users_db' by increasing its storage size to 1000 gigabytes. This is done by calling the `modifyDatabase` API with the database name and new storage size as parameters.\n\nNote that the `start_date` and `end_date` parameters for the `getHVACData` API are not provided in the task instruction, so we leave them empty. The `getThermalComfort` API returns a single response, so we only need one API call. The `modifyDatabase` API returns a single response as well.",
    "Here is the list of API calls based on the task instruction:\n\n```\n[\n    {\"api\": \"detectObjects\", \n    \"parameters\": {\"range\": \"9.0\", \"angle\": \"40.3\"}, \n    \"responses\": [\"detected_objects\", \"object_positions\", \"velocity\"]},\n    {\"api\": \"getAnimalPathology\", \n    \"parameters\": {\"animal_type\": \"dog\", \"disease\": \"infection\", \"gender\": \"male\"}, \n    \"responses\": [\"pathology_info\", \"diagnosis_date\", \"veterinarian\"]},\n    {\"api\": \"analyzeMotorControlPattern\", \n    \"parameters\": {\"athlete_id\": \"71\", \"task_type\": \"balance\"}, \n    \"responses\": [\"motor_control_pattern\"]},\n    {\"api\": \"getInvertebrateDetails\", \n    \"parameters\": {\"species_name\": \"Honeybee\"}, \n    \"responses\": [\"species_name\", \"habitat\", \"reproduction\", \"lifecycle\"]\n]\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown of how I arrived at the API calls:\n\n1. \"I need your assistance in my research project on radar systems. First, I would like to detect and track objects using a radar system with a range of 9.0 kilometers and an angle of detection of 40.3 degrees. Please provide the list of detected objects, their positions, and their velocities.\"\n\t* This corresponds to the \"detectObjects\" API, with parameters \"range\" set to 9.0 and \"angle\" set to 40.3, and responses \"detected_objects\", \"object_positions\", and \"velocity\".\n2. \"Next, I am interested in veterinary pathology. Retrieve information about dogs with a specific infection in males.\"\n\t* This corresponds to the \"getAnimalPathology\" API, with parameters \"animal_type\" set to \"dog\", \"disease\" set to \"infection\", and \"gender\" set to \"male\", and responses \"pathology_info\", \"diagnosis_date\", and \"veterinarian\".\n3. \"After that, analyze the motor control pattern of Athlete ID 71 in the balance task.\"\n\t* This corresponds to the \"analyzeMotorControlPattern\" API, with parameters \"athlete_id\" set to 71 and \"task_type\" set to \"balance\", and response \"motor_control_pattern\".\n4. \"Finally, retrieve details about the Honeybee species, including its natural habitat, reproductive behavior, and lifecycle stages.\"\n\t* This corresponds to the \"getInvertebrateDetails\" API, with parameter \"species_name\" set to \"Honeybee\", and responses \"species_name\", \"habitat\", and \"lifecycle\".",

First, we need to calculate the supply chain efficiency for the electronics product category at a warehouse location from 2022-01-01 to 2022-12-31. This requires the `calculateSupplyChainEfficiency` API with the `start_date`, `end_date`, `product_category`, and `location` parameters.\n2. Then, we need to retrieve the moisture content of Walnut wood. This requires the `getWoodMoistureContent` API with the `wood_type` parameter set to `Walnut`.\n3. Finally, we need to create a drafting element of a line with a specific length in architectural drafting. This requires the `createDraftingElement` API with the `element_type` set to `line` and `properties` set to `length`.\n\nThe responses for each API call are not used as parameter values in this case, but are included in the output as per the task instruction.",
