Here is the output:\n\n```\n[\n  {\"api\": \"getHealthWorkforce\", \"parameters\": {\"location\": \"str\", \"occupation\": \"str\"}, \n  \"responses\": [\"health_workers\"]\n]\n```\n\nExplanation: The task_instruction is to \"Retrieve information about the number of nurses in a specific country\", which requires the getHealthWorkforce API to retrieve the number of health workers in a specific location. The location parameter is set to the country and the occupation parameter is set to \"nurses\" to get the number of nurses in that country.",
    "Here is the list of APIs to be called based on the task instruction:\n\n```\napi_calling_list = [\n    {\"api\": \"getSocialMediaEngagement\", \n    \"parameters\": {\"platform\": \"Facebook\", \"post_id\": \"rOBhSVKGVKe\"}, \n    \"responses\": [\"likes\", \"comments\", \"shares\"]\n], \n{\"api\": \"retrievePostMetrics\", \n\"parameters\": {\"platform\": \"Facebook\", \"post_id\": \"rOBhSVKGVKe\"}, \n\"responses\": [\"likes\", \"comments\", \"shares\"]\n]\n```\n\nHere's the explanation:\n\n1. The task instruction is to get the engagement metrics for a Facebook post with the ID \"rOBhSVKGVKe\". \n2. The `getSocialMediaEngagement` API can be used to get the engagement metrics of a specific social media post, and it requires the platform and post_id as parameters. \n3. The `retrievePostMetrics` API can also be used to get the engagement metrics for a specific social media post, and it requires the platform and post_id as parameters. \n4. Both APIs can be used to get the likes, comments, and shares of the post, so these are included in the responses.",

The task instruction is to send a message via satellite communication, so we need to use the `sendSatelliteMessage` API.\n2. The `sendSatelliteMessage` API requires a `message` parameter, which is the message to be sent via satellite communication. We set this to the task instruction \"Tell the satellite to send the message \"Don't forget to feed the cat.\"\n3. The `sendSatelliteMessage` API returns a `status` response, which we include in the `responses` list.\n4. Since the task instruction does not specify a recipient, we need to use another API to send the message. We choose the `sendMessage` API, which requires a `recipient` and a `message` parameter. We set the `recipient` to an empty string (assuming this is a default value or a placeholder) and the `message` to the task instruction.\n5. The `sendMessage` API returns a `status` response, which we include in the `responses` list.\n\nNote that we don't use the `ping` or `sendSMS` APIs because they are not relevant to the task instruction. The `sendAviationMessage` API requires more parameters than we have information for, so we don't use it.",

The task instruction is to find available rooms in New York from November 25, 2013, to January 7, 2006. This requires the `getAvailableRooms` API to get the available rooms information.\n2. The `getAvailableRooms` API requires `location`, `check_in_date`, and `check_out_date` as parameters. So, we set these parameters accordingly.\n3. The `roomAvailability` API is also required to check the availability of rooms for the same dates. It requires `check_in_date` and `check_out_date` as parameters.\n4. The `getAvailability` API is required to check the availability of rooms in a hospitality establishment. Since no parameters are required for this API, we pass an empty dictionary.\n5. The responses for each API are the available rooms information, room details, and availability of rooms respectively.",

The task instruction is \"Find a shelter near the specified address.\" which means we need to find a homeless shelter near a specific location. The `findShelter` API is suitable for this task as it allows us to specify a location and returns the name, address, and contact number of the shelter.\n2. We need to specify the location, so we pass the address as the value for the `location` parameter. We don't have any preference for gender and age range, so we set them to \"any\".\n3. After finding the shelter, we need to get more information about the shelter. The `getShelter` API is suitable for this task as it allows us to specify a location and returns the available shelter options at that location. We pass the same location as the value for the `location` parameter.\n\nNote: The `bookLodging` and `getLabAnimalHousing` APIs are not relevant to this task, and the `getAvailableSpace` API doesn't require any parameters, so they are not included in the list.",

The task instruction is to \"Train the robot to grasp objects using the dataset \"The bird is singing\". This means we need to train the robot to perform the task of grasping objects. We can use the `trainRobot` API for this. The `task` parameter should be set to \"grasp objects\" and the `dataset` parameter should be set to \"The bird is singing\".\n2. After training the robot, we need to instruct the robot to perform the task of grasping. We can use the `performRobotTask` API for this.

The `object`, `location`, `gripper_type`, and `speed` parameters are also required, but we don't have this information yet. We'll come back to this later.\n3. After the robot is trained and instructed, we can use the `controlRobot` API to control the robot to perform the task of grasping. The `robot_id` parameter is required, and we'll need to get this from the `performRobotTask` API response. The `task` parameter is also required, and we'll set it to \"grasp\". The `object`, `location`, `gripper_type`, and `force` parameters are also required, but we don't have this information yet. We'll come back to this later.

First, we need to analyze the wind energy potential in New York at a height of 19.4 meters using the 'analyzeWindEnergy' API. This requires the 'location' and 'height' parameters. So, we create an API call with these parameters.\n2. Then, we need to retrieve the energy supply for this location using the 'getEnergySupply' API. This requires the 'location' parameter. We use the same 'location' as obtained from the previous API call.\n3. Finally, we need to optimize the scalability and performance of the web application named 'OptiScalApp' which currently has a traffic load of 66 using the 'optimizeScalability' API.

If the `api_name` matches the required API, it creates a new dictionary with the API name, parameters, and responses. The parameters are generated based on the `parameters` dictionary of the API. The responses are hardcoded as \"API_call_0\", \"API_call_1\", or \"API_call_2\". The `get` method is used to get the default value if the key is 'height' or 'timeframe' or 'server_count' or 'database_connections' to avoid KeyError. The `description` is used as the value for other parameters. The last API call's responses are appended to the list.",

First, we need to retrieve the pharmacokinetics information of Aspirin with a dose of 500 mg administered orally. This requires the `getPharmacokineticsInfo` API with the parameters `drug_name` as \"Aspirin\", `dose` as 500.0, `administration_route` as \"oral\", and `patient_age` and `patient_weight` as empty (since these are not specified in the task instruction).\n2. Next, we need to retrieve the drug metabolism information of Aspirin with the genetic variant CYP2C19*2. This requires the `getDrugMetabolism` API with the parameters `drug_name` as \"Aspirin\", `genetic_variant` as \"CYP2C19*2\", and `patient_id` and `dosage` as empty (since these are not specified in the task instruction).\n3. Finally, we need to obtain the hormone levels of the animal with the unique ID pHMnVc19oDeW, specifically for cortisol. This requires the `getHormoneLevels` API with the parameters `animal_id` as \"pHMnVc19oDeW\" and `hormone_type` as \"cortisol\", and `time_interval` as empty (since this is not specified in the task instruction).\n\nNote that I assumed the `patient_age` and `patient_weight` are not specified in the task instruction, so I left them as empty.

First, we need to retrieve the patient profile information with the ID '8sA3YhPQW45X'. This is done by calling the `getPatientProfile` API with the patient ID as a parameter.\n2. Then, we need to find the nearest pharmacy to the location '123 Main Street'. This is done by calling the `getNearestPharmacy` API with the location and radius (500 meters) as parameters. We also need to specify that the pharmacies should be open at the current time, so we set `open_now` to `true`.\n3. After getting the nearest pharmacy, we need to check its availability for a medicine. We don't know which medicine yet, so we'll call `getMedicineAvailability` API with the pharmacy name as a parameter later.
