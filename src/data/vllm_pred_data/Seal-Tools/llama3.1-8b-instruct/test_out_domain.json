The task instruction is \"Turn on the light in the kitchen.\" which means we need to turn on the light in the kitchen. So, we need to call the `turnOnLight` API with the room as \"kitchen\" and a brightness level of 5 and a color of white.\n2. After turning on the light, we need to control the light to ensure it's on. So, we call the `controlLight` API with the light_id as an empty string (assuming it's not provided) and action as \"on\".\n3. Finally, we need to open the curtains in the kitchen to ensure the light is not obstructed. So, we call the `openCurtains` API with the room as \"kitchen\".\n\nNote: The `controlLight` API requires a light_id, but it's not provided in the task instruction, so we assume it's not provided.

First, we need to retrieve information about an employee with ID number 19 from the Hospitality/Human Resource Management department, so we call the `getEmployeeInfo` API with `employee_id` as 19.\n2. Then, we need to update the firmware of a device w349pDicXI8 in the Internet of Things network to version 5.1.2, so we call the `updateDeviceFirmware` API with `device_id` as w349pDicXI8 and `firmware_version` as 5.1.2.\n3. Finally, we need to retrieve the backup file of the 'customers' database from the Information Technology/Information Systems department, so we call the `getDatabaseBackup` API with `database_name` as 'customers'.\n\nNote that the `getEmployeeInfo` API returns multiple responses (`name`, `position`, and `department`), but we don't need all of them, so we only include `employee_id` in the responses list. Similarly, the `updateDeviceFirmware` API returns a single response (`status`), and the `getDatabaseBackup` API returns a single response (`backup_file`).",

First, we need to create a new IoT device for the smart home system. This is done by calling the `createIoTDevice` API with the parameters `device_name` as \"smart_thermostat\" and `device_type` as \"temperature sensor\". The response of this API will be the `device_id` of the newly created device, which we will store in `API_call_0`.\n2. Then, we need to check the status of the device with the assigned `device_id`. This is done by calling the `checkDeviceStatus` API with the `device_id` as the response from the previous API call, which is `API_call_0`. The response of this API will be the status of the device, which we will store in `API_call_1`.\n\nHere's the code to generate this list:\n```\napi_calling_list = []\nfor api in api_list:\n    if api['api_name'] == 'createIoTDevice':\n        api_calling_list.append({\"api\": api['api_name'], \"parameters\": {param['name']: param['example'] for param in api['parameters'].values() if param['name'] in api['required']})\n    elif api['api_name'] == 'checkDeviceStatus':\n        api_calling_list.append({\"api\": api['api_name'], \"parameters\": {\"device_id\": API_call_0})\n    elif api['api_name'] == 'createMobileApp':\n        pass  # This API is not needed for this task\n    elif api['api_name'] == 'getDeviceInfo':\n        pass  # This API is not needed for this task\n    elif api['api_name'] == 'getDeviceData':\n        pass  # This API is not needed for this task\n    API_call_0 = api_calling_list[-1]['parameters']['device_id']\n    api_calling_list[-1]['responses'].append(API_call_1)\n    API_call_1 = api_calling_list[-1]['responses'][0]\nprint(api_calling_list)\n```\n\nThis code iterates over the `api_list` and checks the API name. If the API name matches the required API, it creates a dictionary with the API name and parameters. For the `createIoTDevice` API, it uses the example values for the parameters.
